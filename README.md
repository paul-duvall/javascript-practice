## Custom HTTP Library

This project was created using the Modern Javascript from the Beginning course. It is a simple custom AJAX library with works with the JSONPlaceholder REST API. This API is designed to practice these skills allows for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

This project uses callback functions to ensure that requests happen asynchronously.

## Custom HTTP Library 2

Also created using Modern Javascript from the Beginning, this alternative version is created using the fetch API, promises and arrow functions.

## Github user search app

Created using Modern Javascript from the Beginning, this app pulls in data from the Github user API in order to populate single user search results that dynamically update with each keyup event. Data is pulled in using async / await and fetch. Content is generated using a template literal.

## Random user generator

Created primarily as practice of using fetch API, this project uses the randomuser.me API. For the Javascript layout, a tutorial article was used initially (this proved beneficial for a couple of reasons, in particular I liked how the writer used variables to store code that would be used repeatedly and to streamline the functions and make them more readable). 

This basic structure was heavily edited in order to add more detail to be displayed for each 'author', allowing me to practice using data sourced from an API. The CSS and HTML structure was all put in place independently.

## Fetch API Practice

A little demo project completed in order to further reinforce understanding of Fetch API, completed using a tutorial from Traversy Media. Also used Bootstap for some quick and simple styling - a nice reminder of this technology, which I hadn't used for a while. I love how easy it is to quickly add in margin without writing any CSS

## Form validation using regular expressions

Some much-needed additional practice using regular expressions in a practical context - validating user information entered into a form. Uses classList.add and .remove to apply bootstrap styles to show user alerts when they enter invalid responses.

## Profile scroller

Built to practice using Javascript iterators using Javascript from the beginning. Generators user profiles using an array of objects, iterating through using an iterator. Loads the initial profile on load and resets once the end of the array has been reached.

## Tracalorie calorie counter

Built using Javascript From the Beginning, the Tracalorie app represents a step up in complexity of applications created and the culmination of the the Javascript from the beginning course (it is the penultimate project in the course).

This meal and calorie tracker uses the Javascript Module pattern, one of several patterns that have been introduced in this course. Local storage will be used to persist the data after page reload / closing browser. The Javascript is split into several module controllers - local storage, item, UI, main app.

For the styling, this project uses Bootstap as well as Font Awesome.
